## ✨ What is this?

**Professor Layton – Puzzle Archive** is a lightweight, static web archive containing  
the puzzles from the *Professor Layton* series — presented in a way that is:

- Clear
- Accurate
- Free from fluff
- Actually playable with the provided assets

Each puzzle page focuses **only on what matters**:
the puzzle itself, its hints, and its solution.

No accounts.  
No ads.  
No backend.  

Just puzzles.

Made with ❤️ by **Ferran**

## 🧩 What you can do

- 🖼️ View the **original puzzle images**
- 🔓 Reveal **hints one-by-one**, in the intended order
- ✅ View the **solution** (images and/or text)
- 🔍 **Search** by puzzle number, title, or content
- 🎲 Jump to a **Random Puzzle**
- 🚫 Instantly see which puzzles are **impossible / broken**

Everything runs client-side using static files.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Only relevant content
- Puzzle images
- Hint 1 / Hint 2 / Hint 3
- Solution  

*(Progress scenes, rewards, and story fluff are intentionally excluded)*

### 🧩 Sequential hints
Hints unlock in order —  
**Hint 2 only becomes available after Hint 1**, just like in the games.

### 🎲 Random Puzzle
Instantly jump to a random puzzle without browsing pages.

Perfect for:
- “Give me one to solve”
- Casual replay
- Testing logic skills

### 🔍 Search & navigation
- Search by puzzle number (`#025`)
- Search by title or text
- Clean pagination with progress indicator

### 🚫 Impossible puzzles (auto-updating)
Some puzzles **cannot be solved correctly** with the available assets alone  
(e.g. they require physical interaction, motion, or missing context).

These are automatically flagged:

- Marked visually in the UI
- Explained via tooltip
- Maintained in a central list
- Updated without touching UI code

---

## 🚫 Impossible / Infeasible puzzles

<!-- IMPOSSIBLE:START -->

Known broken / unsolvable puzzles are flagged in the UI:

- 006 — *Light Weight*
- 009 — *One Poor Pooch*
- 019 — *Parking Lot Gridlock (US) / Car Park Gridlock (UK)*
- 025 — *Equilateral Triangle*
- 135 — *Royal Escape (US) / Queen's Escape (UK)*

<!-- IMPOSSIBLE:END -->

## 🧠 Scraping Logic (Important)

The scraper is intentionally **strict and conservative**.

It **only collects images that appear under**:

* `Puzzle xxx`
* `Hint 1`
* `Hint 2`
* `Hint 3`
* `Solution`

Anything **before the puzzle header** or
**after the “Progress” section** is ignored.

This avoids:

* Scene/story fluff
* Reward screens
* UI junk not relevant to solving puzzles

The goal is **accuracy over completeness**.

---

## ▶️ How to run the scraper

```bash
python scrape.py
```

This generates or updates:

```text
puzzles.json
```

You can limit how many puzzles are scraped by editing:

```python
MAX_PUZZLES = 30
```

## 🌍 Viewing the site

### Local

Just open:

```text
index.html
```

(No build step required)

### GitHub Pages

This project is designed to work perfectly as a **static GitHub Pages site**.

Once pushed, it’s live immediately.

---

## 🧠 Design philosophy

* Static-first
* No JavaScript frameworks
* No server dependencies
* Minimal UI chrome
* Respect the original puzzle flow

If a puzzle **cannot be solved fairly**, it is marked — not hidden.
